                        <h4>What is SWOC Analysis?</h4>
                        <p>A SWOC Analysis is a reflective tool used to understand yourself or a project by examining four key areas:
                        </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Strengths</strong> – The internal abilities, qualities, or skills that give you an advantage.</li>
                            <li><strong>Weaknesses</strong> – The internal areas where you need improvement.</li>
                            <li><strong>Opportunities</strong> – External factors or situations that can help you grow or perform better.</li>
                            <li><strong>Challenges</strong> – External difficulties or obstacles that may affect your progress.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>SWOC analysis helps in self-development, planning, and better decision-making by giving a clear picture of where you currently stand and what you need to work on.</p>

                        <h3 class="content-title" style="color: white; border-bottom: none;">MY LEARNING FROM SWOC ANALYSIS</h3>
                        <p>From my SWOC analysis, I learned a lot about myself both academically and personally. I understood that I have strong abilities in grasping concepts, staying calm under pressure, and presenting information clearly. These strengths give me confidence that I can do well when I put in effort. At the same time, identifying my weaknesses—like procrastination, inconsistent study habits, and hesitation to ask doubts—helped me see what exactly I need to work on. I realised that these habits don’t define me; they are simply areas that can improve with time and discipline. I also learned that I have many opportunities around me, from online resources to skill-building activities, which I should take advantage of. The challenges taught me that time management and focus are essential for my success. Overall, this analysis helped me become more self-aware and motivated to grow into a better, more disciplined version of myself.</p>
